```elixir
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, :atom, "string"]

Enum.reduce(list, 0, fn x, acc ->
  if is_number(x) and x > 3 do
    acc + x
  else
    acc
  end
end)
```
This corrected version uses `is_number(x)` to check if the element `x` is a number before attempting the addition. This prevents runtime errors and ensures that only numeric values greater than 3 are summed.
